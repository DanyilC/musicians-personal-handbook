# Musicians Personal Handbook

## About this project
Musicians Personal Handbook is designed to help people that are eager to learn music theory or write their songs
by providing them with music scales, their different modes, and chords that fall within them. The
program is designed to be especially helpful for musicians that play a stringed instrument, as it
will display all the entire chromatic scale, notes that fall within the scale or one of itâ€™s modes,
that they will be able to choose from the list, and finger placements for chords right on their
computer screen. The program will also allow its user to save presets of their favorite tunings,
scales, modes, and chords. It will also feature the options menu, where the user will be able to
change the background of the program, change the type and appearance of the instrument
displayed on the screen, import or export their presets, and turn the sound on or off.
